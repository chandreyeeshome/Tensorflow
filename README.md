# CatsVSDogs [Tensorflow]
This was my project for showcasing on the finale of Machine Learning and Tensorflow Bootcamp (Skepsis X GDSC SNU)
This is a classification project where the model predicts whether the input image is cat or dog.

## Working
- STEP 1 : Imported dataset from Google drive
- STEP 2 : Imported libraries
- STEP 3 : Preprocessing
          <ul>
           <li> Splitting dataset into train and test sets </li>
           <li> Scaling of dataset </li>
          </ul>
- STEP 4 : Defining model architecture
- STEP 5 : Model building
- STEP 6 : Model training
- STEP 7 : Model evaluation
- STEP 8 : Prediction with custom input
- STEP 9 : Model saving
