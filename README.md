# CatsVSDogs [Tensorflow]
This was my project for showcasing on the finale of Machine Learning and Tensorflow Bootcamp (Skepsis X GDSC SNU)
This is a classification project where the model predicts whether the input image is cat or dog.

## Working
STEP 1 : Imported dataset from Google drive
STEP 2 : Imported libraries
STEP 3 : Preprocessing
         a) Splitting dataset into train and test sets 
         b) Scaling of dataset
STEP 4 : Defining model architecture
STEP 5 : Model building
STEP 6 : Model training
STEP 7 : Model evaluation
STEP 8 : Prediction with custom input
STEP 9 : Model saving
